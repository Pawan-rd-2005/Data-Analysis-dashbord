# Pawan Data-Analysis-dashbord Project
"I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization."


**About the Project**

This project focuses on analyzing data using Excel/Power BI by creating multiple interactive dashboards and structured tables. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful insights through systematic stages such as data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization. The dashboards provide a clear and interactive view of patterns, trends, and key performance indicators, making the decision-making process more efficient.

**Objectives**

Data Preprocessing – Organize and prepare raw datasets to ensure consistency and usability.

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inaccuracies for reliable analysis.

Dashboard Creation – Build multiple interactive dashboards that display KPIs, trends, and summaries.

Data Visualization – Use charts, tables, and visuals to make insights easily understandable.

Decision Support – Provide actionable insights that can assist in strategy, planning, and performance monitoring.

**Key Features / Highlights****

Built interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities.

Designed dynamic reports for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).

Implemented data cleaning techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.

Used visual storytelling through charts, pivot tables, and advanced visuals.

Automated reporting processes to save time and improve efficiency.

Applied problem-solving and analytical thinking to extract actionable insights.
