# Pawan Data-Analysis-dashbord Project
"I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization."


**About the Project**

This project focuses on analyzing data using Excel/Power BI by creating multiple interactive dashboards and structured tables. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful insights through systematic stages such as data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization. The dashboards provide a clear and interactive view of patterns, trends, and key performance indicators, making the decision-making process more efficient.
