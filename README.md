# Pawan Data-Analysis-dashbord Project
"I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization."


**About the Project**

This project focuses on analyzing data using Excel/Power BI by creating multiple interactive dashboards and structured tables. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful insights through systematic stages such as data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization. The dashboards provide a clear and interactive view of patterns, trends, and key performance indicators, making the decision-making process more efficient.

**Objectives**

Data Preprocessing – Organize and prepare raw datasets to ensure consistency and usability.

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inaccuracies for reliable analysis.

Dashboard Creation – Build multiple interactive dashboards that display KPIs, trends, and summaries.

Data Visualization – Use charts, tables, and visuals to make insights easily understandable.

Decision Support – Provide actionable insights that can assist in strategy, planning, and performance monitoring.

**Key Features / Highlights****

Built interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities.

Designed dynamic reports for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).

Implemented data cleaning techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.

Used visual storytelling through charts, pivot tables, and advanced visuals.

Automated reporting processes to save time and improve efficiency.

Applied problem-solving and analytical thinking to extract actionable insights.

**Questions**

What are the key KPIs shown on the dashboard and why are they important?

Which visual (chart/table) gives the most critical insight, and how would you interpret it?

How can slicers and filters change the story of the dashboard?

What trend do you observe over time (monthly/quarterly/yearly) in the data?

Which region/product/department contributes the most to the overall performance?

How is target vs. actual performance shown, and what does it reveal?

What are the outliers or exceptions visible in the dashboard?

If you drill down into the data, what deeper insights can be uncovered?

Which DAX measures or calculations are likely used to build this dashboard?

If you had to improve this dashboard, what one change would you suggest and why?
